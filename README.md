# URN "thread" Registry

This Git repository contains the registry for [Uniform Resource Names (URNs)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8141.html) managed by [Thread Group, Inc.](https://www.threadgroup.org/). 
All URNs of the form "urn:thread:...." are in scope of this registry. The namespace identifier (NID) is "thread".

## Registry
[registry.md](registry.md) contains the registered entries. This document is under change control by the Technical Committee of the Thread Group.

## IANA Registration
Registration of the "thread" URN namespace has been requested (using [this template](urn-registration-v1.txt) in 2024. Once approved, the entry will appear in the [IANA Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespaces registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces/urn-namespaces.xhtml).
